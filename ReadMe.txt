This is a code written in C++ which reports the top trending tags in the given input file.
This is achieved by using Max Fibonacci Heap and a Hash Table to make the operation faster.
Tested on a sample input file with over million tags. Sample input and output files are provided 
in the repository. The program takes the input in the form of a text file named SampleInput.txt 
and generates an output text file name sampleOutput.txt in the same directory with the trending 
tags. The number of trending tags can be given as a parameter in the program.
